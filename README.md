# Hi there 👋, I'm Shashank



I specialize in building scalable, efficient systems that impact real-world operations. I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer at Synechron Technologies**, where I focus on **backend systems** and **API integrations**.

### 🛠 What I Do:
- **Backend Development**: Whether it's integrating complex systems or optimizing code performance, I'm on it.

- **System Designs & Distributed Systems**: Designed robust architectures and pushed scalability while avoiding what I call "the log-everything-until-production-crashes" design pattern (learned that the hard way).

### 💻 Some Projects I'm Proud Of:
- **URL SHORTNER**.
- **BookMyShow Clone**. 

### 🌍 Open to Opportunities:
- Looking for roles where I can leverage my skills in **backend development**, **cloud infrastructure**
- **Relocation?** You name the place, I’ll be there (as long as they have Wi-Fi).

⚡ **Fun fact**: I’m the guy who learned never to push to production on a Friday. But hey, if you're feeling adventurous, maybe we can break the rules together. 😜
